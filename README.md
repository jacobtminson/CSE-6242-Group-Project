1. Our final README.txt is on Teams (/General/Data/README-update-this-file.docx)\
  -> everyone, please write on the word document above
2. Download the folder '/team003final' locally to run the UI
3. Download the rawdata 'All Data Files' from (https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/data/)
  -> then extract the .zip file 
  -> then place the extracted folder (/data) right under '/team003final' 
4. Set current directory to 'team003final'\
  -> e.g. on your terminal write: cd User/CSE6242/team003final
5. Run the model to get all the necessary files for the UI\
  -> you only need to run this ONCE!\
  -> this takes about an hour..\
  -> e.g. on your terminal write: python CODE/data_ranked_list.py
6. Run the UI (after 5. is done)\
  -> e.g. on your terminal write: python CODE/college_audit_dash.py
7. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8050/ on server
